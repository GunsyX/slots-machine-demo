# CONTEXT

This project has been forked off one of my projects which was forked off my own boilerplate for react projects. <b>All code is 100% owned and written by me.</b>

Pulled an all nighter to do this since I don't get time during the day as much.
I've never used typescript but I can easily learn it for the job. The same goes for unit tests at backend, I've never used them before, would be only a hurdle to force both of these into this demo project.

Might make another commit after waking up, with cleaner code.

Run `yarn start` and `node server/server` on the project root directory.
Access the demo at `http://127.0.0.1:2000/` on your local host.

-- below are the previous notes I wrote for the boilerplate --
